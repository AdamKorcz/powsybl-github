# PowSyBl maintainers

The PowSyBl project is split in several repository so we decided to dispatch the responsibility of the repositories between maintainers, either for the code review or to release to code. You can find, for each repository, the person in charge on the [PowSyBl website](https://www.powsybl.org/pages/documentation/developer/repositories/).
